# Project 3 affordable_housing

# Background
Review Affordable Housing options within the 10 Austin council districts to answer the following questions: 1) How does affordable housing options differ via district?; 2) Whare are the demographics of the residents in each district and theri household income?; 3) What is the average rental and/or housing price per district? The purpose is to locate how the districts are equitably (if at all) dividing up their affordable housing opportunities among the districts after reveiwing for racial/ethnic background, median housing and rental pricing, and median family income. We hope to propose our findings to the Austin Council to provide more affordable options equitably and equally among their districts. 

The data being used is from 2023 and ethical considerations are that they are using census data, which may not include all qualified personnel, however, the affordable housing options have been provided by the City as part of their housing project. the data was relatively "clean" prior to removing excess columns.
